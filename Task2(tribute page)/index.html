      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p class="para">
        Bhagat Singh was born on September 28, 1907, in Banga village, Punjab, British India. He grew up in a Sikh family that was deeply patriotic and politically active. From a young age, he was influenced by stories of sacrifice from the Indian freedom struggle, especially those of his uncle Ajit Singh and father Kishan Singh.
        <br><br>
        As a teenager, he was deeply disturbed by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in 1919 and British atrocities, which set him firmly on the path of revolution. He studied European revolutionary movements and believed in the power of organized resistance.

        Bhagat Singh joined the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA), where he aimed to liberate India through armed revolution. In 1928, after the death of Lala Lajpat Rai due to police brutality, Bhagat Singh and his associates killed British officer John Saunders in retaliation.
        <br><br>
        In 1929, he and Batukeshwar Dutt threw bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly—not to harm, but to make a statement. His bold court speeches, defiant hunger strike, and fearless demeanor won the hearts of millions across the nation.
